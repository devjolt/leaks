        It is expected that customers who have left their homes for extended periods will take
        precautionary measures to prevent unnecessary water use. Closing the service valve at
        the meter is one way to prevent these issues, but the customer should take care to
        ensure the pipes in their home do not freeze and any other appliances or fixtures that
        require water will not be affected.
